# Problem Statement
We'd like to be able to import an arbitrary CSV file into GEMS GDA for analysis. DLOG99 will convert a CSV into an STF but the input CSV must be structured in a certain way. This solution will facilitate the conversion of an arbitrary CSV format into the DLOG99-compatible format.

# Requirements
- Solution shall compute total time if necessary.
- Solution shall relocate total time to the first column if necessary.
- Solution shall convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians if necessary.
- Solution shall have predefined CSV import templates for common file structurings.

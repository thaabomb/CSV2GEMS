# Problem Statement
We'd like to be able to import an arbitrary CSV file into GEMS GDA for analysis. DLOG99 will convert a CSV into an STF but the input CSV must be structured in a certain way. This solution will facilitate the conversion of an arbitrary CSV format into the DLOG99-compatible format.

# Requirements
- Solution shall provide an interactive command line interface.
- Solution shall import an arbitrary CSV.
  - Solution shall allow the user to specify which line contains parameter names.
  - Solution shall allow the user to specify which line is the first line of data.
  - Solution shall allow the user to specify which line is the last line of data.
